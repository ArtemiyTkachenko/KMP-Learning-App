# Architecture Notes

## Application Composition

Shared UI dependencies that are local to the current Compose shell are still
assembled manually at `App()` and passed into `AppShell()` as an explicit
parameter object.

The local curriculum data graph now uses Koin because E07 introduced concrete
runtime dependencies that need platform-aware composition: `CurriculumDatabase`,
`CurriculumImporter`, `CurriculumDataInitializer`, and
`CurriculumRepository`. Koin is started by the Android `Application`, combines
the shared curriculum module with the Android database module, and uses the
classic DSL only. Koin annotations, compiler plugins, Compose injection, and
ViewModel DSLs are deferred until a real requirement appears.

Android startup now follows:

```text
Application
  -> start Koin
MainActivity
  -> await local curriculum initialization
  -> App()
```

`CurriculumRepository` is the application-facing data boundary intended for
E08 assessment-engine work. Runtime reads should depend on that interface
rather than on Room entities, DAOs, or the local repository implementation.

Shared presentation ViewModels are resolved from the Koin Compose module at the
Navigation 3 destination boundary. Parameterized destinations pass only stable
route data into their ViewModels, while Navigation 3 entry-scoped ViewModel
ownership remains intact: each back-stack entry receives its own
ViewModelStore, and the ViewModel is cleared when that entry is removed.

Android and Desktop share `AppRoot(initialize)` in shared `commonMain`. It owns
the startup loading, failure, and retry states around the platform initializer
and then enters `App()`. Hosts supply only their own initializer, so a failed
initialization cannot leave a host without content. `App()` keeps its own
`MaterialTheme` so it remains usable directly by hosts that bypass `AppRoot`.

### Runtime Host Coverage

`App()` compiles for every configured target, but only Android and Desktop are
runnable products today:

| Host | Koin graph started by | Database builder | Runnable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android | `KmpLearningApplication` -> `startAndroidLocalDataGraph` | `CurriculumDatabase.android.kt` | yes |
| Desktop (JVM) | `desktopApp/main.kt` -> `startDesktopLocalDataGraph` | `CurriculumDatabase.jvm.kt` | yes |
| iOS | none | none | no |
| Web (JS / Wasm) | none | none | no |

`shared/src/iosMain/.../MainViewController.kt` and
`webApp/src/webMain/.../main.kt` call `App()` directly without starting Koin, so
the first composition of `TopicBrowserDestination` fails when `koinViewModel { }`
cannot resolve `TopicBrowserViewModel`. There is also no Room database builder
for iOS, JS, or Wasm: `sqlite-bundled` is scoped to the Android runtime and JVM
tests, and the browser targets would need a separate persistence decision.

These targets are kept on purpose. They prove shared common code stays free of
Android-only APIs, and `:webApp:assemble` is part of CI. Making the hosts
actually run is tracked as backlog issue E12-01 rather than being solved
implicitly inside unrelated work.

Note that Kotlin/Native iOS compilations are disabled on the Linux CI runner, so
CI gives no iOS signal at all; iOS compilation is a local macOS check.

## Curriculum Content Model

The curriculum content contract lives in shared `commonMain` code as immutable
Kotlin models with flat Topic, Subtopic, and Question collections linked by
stable string IDs. The flat shape is intentional: it keeps content identity
independent from display text and avoids coupling the model to a future database
or import format.

Substantive content validation lives in `CurriculumValidator` so validation can
report multiple authoring errors for a complete curriculum instead of failing
object construction on the first malformed item. Serialization and local
persistence are handled by the E07 data path while Room-specific metadata stays
out of the curriculum domain models.

## Assessment Domain

The shared assessment model defines focused and mixed assessment configuration,
question attempts, answer identity state, attempt lifecycle, timestamps, and
score summaries without depending on Room, Koin, Compose, Android, or
`CurriculumRepository`. E08 uses `CurriculumRepository` for question selection
and keeps scoring/session behavior separate from persistence.
Question selection follows `AssessmentConfig -> AssessmentQuestionSelector ->
CurriculumRepository`; Mixed selection uses coverage-first rounds across topics
after randomized encounter ordering.
The runtime `AssessmentSession` keeps the selected `Question` objects for
scoring, while `TestAttempt` remains the stable-ID attempt record persisted by
the local attempt store without embedding curriculum content.

`AssessmentRepository` is the domain-facing boundary for durable
`TestAttempt` snapshots. The local implementation delegates to
`AssessmentAttemptStore`, keeping Room entities and DAOs below the repository
interface. Retake creation is separate orchestration:
`AssessmentRetakeService` loads a completed source attempt, starts a new
assessment with the same `AssessmentConfig`, saves the new in-progress
`TestAttempt`, and leaves the source attempt unchanged. Retakes intentionally
use fresh selection without guaranteeing that questions differ from the
original run.

The completed E08 graph is composed with the same classic Koin DSL as the
curriculum graph: `AssessmentQuestionSelector` depends on `CurriculumRepository`,
`AssessmentEngine` depends on the selector, `AssessmentRepository` persists
`TestAttempt` snapshots through `AssessmentAttemptStore`, and
`AssessmentRetakeService` coordinates the repository plus engine. There is no
separate assessment startup initializer because assessment services are lazy
capabilities; Android still awaits curriculum import before entering `App()`.
E09 and E10 should depend on `CurriculumRepository`, `AssessmentRepository`,
`AssessmentEngine`, and `AssessmentRetakeService`, not Room DAOs or entities.

Assessment taking is shared by focused practice and mixed interviews through
`AssessmentTakingViewModel -> AssessmentEngine -> AssessmentSession`.
`AssessmentTakingLaunch.New` accepts either assessment configuration and saves
the initial and per-answer `TestAttempt` snapshots through
`AssessmentRepository` before the UI advances. `ExistingAttempt` reconstructs
the runtime-only session from its stable attempt ID through
`AssessmentSessionLoader`, with the persisted `TestAttempt.config` remaining
authoritative. Product wrappers provide titles and navigation while reusing the
same question, submission, progress, and explicit-completion state machine.

The Mixed Android Interview product starts from a prominent Topics-screen
action and navigates with `MixedInterview(questionCount)` primitive route data.
The route reconstructs `AssessmentConfig.Mixed` at its destination and delegates
to `AssessmentTakingLaunch.New`, so balanced selection, initial persistence,
answer checkpoints, actual selected-question progress, and explicit completion
stay in the shared assessment path. After the initial attempt is persisted, the
config route is replaced by `MixedInterviewAttempt(attemptId)` so saved
navigation restores the existing session instead of creating another attempt.
Focused starts use the same promotion to `FocusedPracticeAttempt(attemptId)`.
Completion replaces the attempt entry with `MixedInterviewResult(attemptId)`;
the result loads the durable `AssessmentScore` from `AssessmentRepository` and
uses `AssessmentReviewLoader` with `CurriculumRepository.getQuestionById` for
ordered historical review. Resolved review Questions are grouped by `topicId`
in attempt encounter order, and `CurriculumRepository.getTopicById` resolves
historical names without ACTIVE filtering. Topic performance is derived in
memory and is not persisted.

Mixed interview repeats follow the same persisted-retake boundary as focused
practice. The Mixed result delegates creation to `AssessmentRetakeService`,
keeps the completed source result in the back stack, and pushes
`MixedInterviewAttempt(retakeAttemptId)` only after the new attempt has been
saved. That route reopens the persisted session through
`AssessmentTakingLaunch.ExistingAttempt`, so balanced selection and
`AssessmentEngine.start()` occur once during retake creation rather than again
when the assessment screen opens.

E09-04 completes the retained session through `AssessmentEngine`, persists the
completed attempt before replacing focused-practice navigation with a stable
attempt-ID result route, and loads historical review through
`AssessmentRepository` plus `CurriculumRepository.getQuestionById`. Deprecated
or missing historical questions are represented per review item without
changing the durable score. Retake behavior remains deferred to E09-05.

E09-05 exposes repeat practice from the result screen through
`AssessmentRetakeService`. The service creates and persists a fresh attempt;
`FocusedPracticeAttempt` then carries only its stable ID, and
`AssessmentSessionLoader` reconstructs the runtime session without calling
`AssessmentEngine.start()` a second time. The source result remains below the
retake in the back stack.

The complete E09 focused-learning path is `TopicBrowser -> TopicDetail ->
AssessmentConfig.Focused -> FocusedPractice -> AssessmentEngine`, with durable
`TestAttempt` checkpoints through `AssessmentRepository`, explicit completion,
and `FocusedPracticeResult(attemptId)` historical reconstruction. A repeat uses
`AssessmentRetakeService`, then navigates by the persisted
`FocusedPracticeAttempt(attemptId)` so `AssessmentSessionLoader` can restore the
runtime-only session without creating a second attempt. Android and Desktop
share this presentation and domain flow; Room and DAOs remain below the
repository boundaries.

Topic detail screens use a Material 3 top app bar for back navigation, with the
navigation icon invoking the existing Navigation 3 back-stack pop. Detail and
practice destinations should keep this phone-style toolbar affordance instead
of rendering a standalone text Back button in page content.
