# Assessment Architecture

How an assessment is configured, run, scored, and persisted. See [overview](overview.md) for app composition and [progress](progress.md) for the statistics derived from completed attempts.

## Assessment Domain

The shared assessment model defines focused and mixed assessment configuration,
question attempts, answer identity state, attempt lifecycle, timestamps, and
score summaries without depending on Room, Koin, Compose, Android, or
`CurriculumRepository`. E08 uses `CurriculumRepository` for question selection
and keeps scoring/session behavior separate from persistence.
Question selection follows `AssessmentConfig -> AssessmentQuestionSelector ->
CurriculumRepository`; Mixed selection uses coverage-first rounds across topics
after randomized encounter ordering. Targeted practice adds level and question
source to that configuration without adding a second engine; see "Targeted
practice selection" below.
The runtime `AssessmentSession` keeps the selected `Question` objects for
scoring, while `TestAttempt` remains the stable-ID attempt record persisted by
the local attempt store without embedding curriculum content.

`AssessmentRepository` is the domain-facing boundary for durable
`TestAttempt` snapshots. The local implementation delegates to
`AssessmentAttemptStore`, keeping Room entities and DAOs below the repository
interface. Retake creation is separate orchestration:
`AssessmentRetakeService` loads a completed source attempt, starts a new
assessment with the same `AssessmentConfig`, saves the new in-progress
`TestAttempt`, and leaves the source attempt unchanged. Retakes intentionally
use fresh selection without guaranteeing that questions differ from the
original run.

## Assessment Graph And Flows

The completed E08 graph is composed with the same classic Koin DSL as the
curriculum graph: `AssessmentQuestionSelector` depends on `CurriculumRepository`,
`AssessmentEngine` depends on the selector, `AssessmentRepository` persists
`TestAttempt` snapshots through `AssessmentAttemptStore`, and
`AssessmentRetakeService` coordinates the repository plus engine. There is no
separate assessment startup initializer because assessment services are lazy
capabilities; Android still awaits curriculum import before entering `App()`.
E09 and E10 should depend on `CurriculumRepository`, `AssessmentRepository`,
`AssessmentEngine`, and `AssessmentRetakeService`, not Room DAOs or entities.

Assessment taking is shared by focused practice and mixed interviews through
`AssessmentTakingViewModel -> AssessmentEngine -> AssessmentSession`.
`AssessmentTakingLaunch.New` accepts either assessment configuration and saves
the initial and per-answer `TestAttempt` snapshots through
`AssessmentRepository` before the UI advances. `ExistingAttempt` reconstructs
the runtime-only session from its stable attempt ID through
`AssessmentSessionLoader`, with the persisted `TestAttempt.config` remaining
authoritative. Product wrappers provide titles and navigation while reusing the
same question, submission, progress, and explicit-completion state machine. The
taking screen pins a linear meter under its top bar, driven by the same
`questionNumber`/`totalQuestions` as the counter, so how far through the assessment
the learner is stays answerable while they read a long question.

The Mixed Android Interview product has its own top-level area. `InterviewStartScreen`
leads with the start action and, once the learner has finished an interview, shows their
latest and best results through `InterviewStartViewModel`; each opens the result it came
from. Starting an interview navigates with `MixedInterview(questionCount)` primitive
route data.
The route reconstructs `AssessmentConfig.Mixed` at its destination and delegates
to `AssessmentTakingLaunch.New`, so balanced selection, initial persistence,
answer checkpoints, actual selected-question progress, and explicit completion
stay in the shared assessment path. After the initial attempt is persisted, the
config route is replaced by `MixedInterviewAttempt(attemptId)` so saved
navigation restores the existing session instead of creating another attempt.
Focused starts use the same promotion to `FocusedPracticeAttempt(attemptId)`.
Completion replaces the attempt entry with `MixedInterviewResult(attemptId)`;
the result loads the durable `AssessmentScore` from `AssessmentRepository` and
uses `AssessmentReviewLoader` with `CurriculumRepository.getQuestionById` for
ordered historical review. Resolved review Questions are grouped by `topicId`
in attempt encounter order, and `CurriculumRepository.getTopicById` resolves
historical names without ACTIVE filtering. Topic performance is derived in
memory and is not persisted.

Mixed interview repeats follow the same persisted-retake boundary as focused
practice. The Mixed result delegates creation to `AssessmentRetakeService`,
keeps the completed source result in the back stack, and pushes
`MixedInterviewAttempt(retakeAttemptId)` only after the new attempt has been
saved. That route reopens the persisted session through
`AssessmentTakingLaunch.ExistingAttempt`, so balanced selection and
`AssessmentEngine.start()` occur once during retake creation rather than again
when the assessment screen opens.

E09-04 completes the retained session through `AssessmentEngine`, persists the
completed attempt before replacing focused-practice navigation with a stable
attempt-ID result route, and loads historical review through
`AssessmentRepository` plus `CurriculumRepository.getQuestionById`. Deprecated
or missing historical questions are represented per review item without
changing the durable score. Retake behavior remains deferred to E09-05.

E09-05 exposes repeat practice from the result screen through
`AssessmentRetakeService`. The service creates and persists a fresh attempt;
`FocusedPracticeAttempt` then carries only its stable ID, and
`AssessmentSessionLoader` reconstructs the runtime session without calling
`AssessmentEngine.start()` a second time. The source result remains below the
retake in the back stack.

The complete E09 focused-learning path is `TopicBrowser -> TopicDetail ->
AssessmentConfig.Focused -> FocusedPractice -> AssessmentEngine`, with durable
`TestAttempt` checkpoints through `AssessmentRepository`, explicit completion,
and `FocusedPracticeResult(attemptId)` historical reconstruction. A repeat uses
`AssessmentRetakeService`, then navigates by the persisted
`FocusedPracticeAttempt(attemptId)` so `AssessmentSessionLoader` can restore the
runtime-only session without creating a second attempt. Android and Desktop
share this presentation and domain flow; Room and DAOs remain below the
repository boundaries.

Topic detail screens use a Material 3 top app bar for back navigation, with the
navigation icon invoking the existing Navigation 3 back-stack pop. Detail and
practice destinations should keep this phone-style toolbar affordance instead
of rendering a standalone text Back button in page content.
